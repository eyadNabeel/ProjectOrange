I will be taking a late day on this assignment.

---------------------- EXTRA CREDIT FEATURES ----------------------
- I added a way to edit the influence values of joints for specific vertices

- The sum of both influences is always 1; increasing one changes the other and 
    vice-versa

- The name of the joint that the vertex is influenced by is displayed below the
    QDoubleSpinBox

- I also added the ability to bind and unbind the mesh to the skeleton, meaning initially,
    the mesh will be unbound to the skeleton, and it'll stay that way till the pushButton
    is pressed
